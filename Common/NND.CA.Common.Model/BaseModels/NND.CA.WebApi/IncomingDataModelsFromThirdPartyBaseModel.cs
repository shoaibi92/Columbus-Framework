 * README: In the WebApi, there are numbers of incoming data models. There is little contol over the 
 * datamodels that are http posted by various vendors. In future, if I want to add some new attribute 
 * I would like to do that homogeniously in here. So, all of those datamodels obey this class. 
 * ToDo:   TBD.
